  <p ion-text color="light">Jaime Lannister is a fictional character in the A Song of Ice and Fire series of fantasy novels by American author George R. R. Martin, and its television adaptation Game of Thrones. He becomes a prominent point of view character in the novels beginning in A Storm of Swords (2000).

      Introduced in A Game of Thrones (1996), Jaime is a knight of the Kingsguard and a member of House Lannister, one of the wealthiest and most powerful families in the fictional kingdom of Westeros. Although he first appears to be unscrupulous and immoral, he later proves to be far more complex, honorable and sympathetic.
      
      Jaime is portrayed by Danish actor Nikolaj Coster-Waldau on the HBO series Game of Thrones. He was nominated for a Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actor on Television, a Critics' Choice Television Award for Best Supporting Actor in a Drama Series and a People Choice Awards Favorite TV Anti-Hero for his performance in the show's third season, and for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series for his performance in the show's seventh season. He and the rest of the cast were nominated for Screen Actors Guild Awards for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series in 2012, 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017.</p>
