  <p ion-text color="light">Ser Barristan Selmy was a knight who served in the Kingsguard with distinction for almost forty years. Nicknamed Barristan the Bold, he was considered by many to be one of the best swordsmen and most honorable men in all the Seven Kingdoms.

      He served in the Kingsguard of King Aerys II Targaryen, and later served as Lord Commander of the Kingsguard during the reigns of King Robert I Baratheon, and, for a short time, King Joffrey I Baratheon. After his public dismissal by Joffrey (an affront, as the Kingsguard is an irrevocable lifetime appointment), Ser Barristan, free of any vows, chooses to serve Daenerys Targaryen.</p>
