  <p ion-text color="light">Bronn is sarcastic, with a black sense of humor and a pragmatic, amoral philosophy for life. However, he is neither completely heartless nor sadistic. He openly expresses sympathy to Tyrion Lannister after making the pragmatic decision not to champion him during Lannister's second trial by combat. After Tyrion asks him if he would murder an innocent baby in front of her mother without question, Bronn denies it and claims that he would ask for a price, implying that he may do the deed, but not for free and not just because he was ordered to. Despite Bronn's avaricious nature, which is sneered at by more honorable knights, he is a skilled and dangerous fighter.</p>
